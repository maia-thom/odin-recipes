    <h2>A simple one-bowl recipe</h2>
    <p>This easy brownie recipe is what we reach for when we want something rich and chocolatey without the wait (like when we remember that potluck at the last minute). It's a simple one-bowl recipe — no melting chocolate, no separating wet and dry ingredients. The result is classic, moist brownies that rise ever so slightly during baking without veering into cakey territory. A handful of chocolate chips adds extra richness and deepens the chocolate flavor. Bake these easy brownies when you want to make a craveable, crowd-pleasing dessert with minimal effort. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (120g) Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (64g) unsweetened cocoa, Dutch-process or natural</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (347g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for enhanced chocolate flavor</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 cup (170g) semisweet chocolate chips, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, place all of the ingredients in the order listed. Stir, then beat the mixture until it's smooth.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake the brownies for about 25 minutes, or until they're just barely beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan. A toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it; you shouldn't see any wet batter.</li>
        <li>Remove the brownies from the oven; let them cool completely before cutting.</li>
        <li>Store any leftover brownies, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ol>
