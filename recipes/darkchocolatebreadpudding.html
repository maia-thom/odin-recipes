        <h2>Leftover bread has never looked so appealing!</h2>
        <p>Made from a custard base that has both cocoa and chopped chocolate, the final texture of this bread pudding is creamy and rich in chocolate flavor. The soaked bread cubes become cake-like when baked, surrounded by chunks of melty chocolate. This is comfort food at its finest.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 1/2 cups (453g) bread cubes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (255g) semisweet chocolate, chopped, or chocolate chips, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup (198g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (43g) unsweetened cocoa, Dutch-process or natural</li>
            <li>3 cups (680g) milk or half-and-half, divided</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 2-quart baking dish, 9" x 13" pan, or equivalent.</li>
            <li>Toss the bread cubes with 1 cup (170g) of the chopped semisweet chocolate, and place in the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Combine the remaining 1/2 cup (85g) chopped chocolate with the sugar, cocoa, and 1 1/2 cups (340g) of the milk or half & half in a saucepan set over low heat.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is thickened and smooth.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large bowl, and whisk in the remaining 1 1/2 cups (340g) milk or half & half. Whisk in the eggs, salt, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture over the bread cubes and let rest for 30 minutes or so at room temperature, until the chocolate custard has been absorbed by the bread.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F.</li>
            <li>Bake the pudding for 45 to 50 minutes, until it's set. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes to allow the custard to fully set before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with whipped cream, ice cream, or dusted with confectioners' sugar.</li>
            <li>Store, refrigerated, for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
